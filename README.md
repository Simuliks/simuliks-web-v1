# simuliks-web-v1
simuliks-dev website first version.
Web only in Lithuanian language.
Needed to change links to your own, for it to work properly.
Not recommended to use for your web of bad optimization choises.
Good to use it for learning purposes.
Demo.rar needed to be extracted, code are obfuscated so it maybe be hard to understand something.
